# Network performance evaluation

    Evaluate different data protocols, TCP, UDP
    
    Metrics:
        - Packet loss
        - Delay
        - Delay delta

        Delay can be affected by package size


    Difference between Debit and throughput:
        Debit has a direct relation with transmission capacity and rate, so, it means it rely only
        on physical conditions of transmission.

    Tools for metric evaluation and analysis:
        - iperf
        - jperf (java)
