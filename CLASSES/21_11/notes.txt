    - Declarative is the one where you just tell what you want, but it doesnt matter~
        other parameters of decision

# DEV OPS:~
    - Development of operations

    Before, there was a huge gap between development sector and Infrastructure sector.
    devops is more like a phylosofy.

    CI/CD = Continuous Integration/Continous Development

    Microservices and devops needs IaaC, without it, there is no use to struct your
    project with Microservices, just use monolith instead.
