#Network layers:
- management plane
- control plane
- data plane

#Traffic engineering opt: 
- graph like structure
- debit link is used as a parameter, usually it doesÂ´t change as often as links
- avoid parameters that change constantly over time

## Routing convergence
- when a link changes, all routers must recalculate their links

AS = autonomous system ----> networks that belong to the same owner
IGP = Interior Gateway protocol
Intradomain Routing = 
EGP = exterior gateway protocol
BGP = border gateway protocol -> fowarding between similar networks
