#Network layers:
    - management plane
    - control plane
    - data plane

#Traffic engineering opt: 
    - graph like structure
    - debit link is used as a parameter, usually it does´t change as often as links
    - avoid parameters that change constantly over time

## Routing convergence
    - when a link changes, all routers must recalculate their links


# current internet organization

    AS = autonomous system ----> networks that belong to the same owner
    IGP = Interior Gateway protocol
    Intradomain Routing = 
    EGP = exterior gateway protocol
    BGP = border gateway protocol -> fowarding between similar networks

# Example

Access Control

solutions are 100% vertical

##Disaggregation applied to computer industry
    . application layer
    . OS layer
    . Hardware layer

## Disaggregation applied to Network industry

    big techs started network Disaggregation by developing it´s own network Hardware, creating an open interface
    paradigm changing / game changer ---> evolution


# Software Defined Network ( SDN ) 
    what makes a difference is almost 100% related to software than Hardware

    examples:
        - VL2 - Microsoft
        - B4 - Google
    Decouple of dataplane and control plane

    It means that we have now a centralized archtecture. It means that control plane is at controller
    Advantage: global network vision
    disavantage: ?

    2 sides

        1. south bound = control plane and dataplane
        2. north bound = applications

        examples: openVSwitch and openDayLight
