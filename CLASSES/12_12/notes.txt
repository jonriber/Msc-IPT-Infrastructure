SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE

# SECURITY GOALS~
    - PREVENTION = PREVENTING ATTACKERS FROM VIOLATING SECURITY POLICY.
    - DETECTION = DETECT AND REPORT SECURITY ATTACKS.
        * IDS (INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM)
            - HIDS (HOSTS)
            - NIDS (NETWORK)
    - RECOVERY = GOALS OF STOPPING ANY ACTIVE ATTACK AND REPAIRING ANY DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE.

# CONFIDENTIALITY
    AAA (AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, ACCOUNTING)

    » AUTHENTICATION = IDENTIFY WHO YOU ATTACKERS
    » AUTHORIZATION = AFTER KNOWING WHO YOU ARE, CHECKS WHAT YOU CAN SCREENSHOTS
    » ACCOUNTING = 

    * HARD TO CLONE SMART CARD 
    * EASY TO CLONE RFID

    - SINGLE FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
    - MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION

    KEYLOGGER CAN OBSERVE YOUR KEYBOARD AND CAN TAKE MULTIPLE SCREENSHOTS.


# INTEGRITY

    - IS THE ACCURACY, CONSISTENCY AND TRUSTWORTHNESS OF DATA DURING ITS ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE
    - ANOTHER TERM FOR INTEGRITY IS QUALITY
    - METHODS USED TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY INCLUDE HASHING VALIDATION CHECKS, DATA CONSISTENCY CHECKS,
    ACCESS CONTROLS.~

    * WHAT IS A HASH: NON-INVERTIBLE FUNCTION, 

# AVAILABILITY
    PRINCIPLE USED TO DESCRIBE THE NEED 

# RISK
    IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT A THREAT EXPLOITS A VULNERABILITY

    RISK CANNOT BE ELIMINATED, IT IS PART OF THE GAME. ONE EXAMPLE IS AN ONLINE STORE, WHICH NEEDS
    TO BE EXPOSED TO THE WEB IN ORDER TO SELL SOMETHING.

    * IMPACT USING A 5 POINT SCALE:
        5 = MAJOR
        4 = SERIOUS
        3 = MODERATE
        2 = MINOR
        1 = NEGLIGIBLE

    * CAN BE CALCULATED USING: R = T*V*C, WHERE
        T = PROBABILITY
        V = VALUE
        C = 
    * RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
        - IDENTIFY RISK FOR DIFFERENT THREATS AND CREATE THE RISK MATRIX

    * RISK MITIGATION:
        - USER NAME + PASSWORD = 80%
        - USERNAME + PASSWORD + FIREWALL = 60%
        - USERNAME + OASSWIRD + FIREWALL + ENCRYPTION = 50%
        - MFA + FIREWALL + ENCRYPTION = 40%
        
    DAMAGE CLASSIFICATION

ATTACKING WITH HASH

ALICE --------EVE - - - - -- - - - - BOB

# MESSAGE DIGEST = USES A MAC (MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE)
    AES(HASH(m),KEY)

APPLICATION FINGERPRINTING = INTERESTING SUBJECT OF RESEARCH AND THESIS
